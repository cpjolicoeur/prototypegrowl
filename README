== Version ==

1.0 - Released March 13, 2009


== Usage ==

To create a new growl use the following code:

    var growl = new Growl.Smoke;
    growl.show( {option: value} );

To create a new growl with the bezel format, use the following code:

    var growl = new Growl.Bezel;
    growl.show( {option: value} );


The following option:value pairs can be set with both Growl.Smoke and Growl.Bezel:

    image: 		'path to image file to use in growl bubble' 
    title: 		'title of growl bubble'
    content:	'message for growl bubble'
    autohide:	time in seconds to display the growl bubble (set to 0 to keep visible until clicked)
    animated:	time in seconds of fade in / fade out animation (set to 0 to prevent animation)
    opacity:	value from 0 - 1 of opacity of growl bubble
