== Usage ==

to create a new growl use the following code:

var growl = new Growl.Smoke;
growl.show({option: value});

The following option:value pairs can be set:

image: 		'path to image file to use in growl bubble' 
title: 		'title of growl bubble'
content:	'message for growl bubble'
autohide:	time in seconds to display the growl bubble (set to 0 to keep visible until clicked)
animated:	time in seconds of fade in / fade out animation (set to 0 to prevent animation)
opacity:	value from 0 - 1 of opacity of growl bubble

== TODO ==

* If using Effects, do a sanity check to make sure the needed libraries
are included.
